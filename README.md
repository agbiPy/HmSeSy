Home Security System Project Overview
A team of four highly skilled individuals has come together to collaborate on a groundbreaking project: the development of a state-of-the-art home security system. In a job market where, recent graduates are often overlooked due to a perceived lack of experience, we are determined to prove that we have the capabilities to innovate and excel. As graduates of the University of Bedfordshire, our aim is to create a cutting-edge security solution that challenges the notion that fresh graduates are unqualified for complex tasks.
Team Members and Roles:
Uche Nwoko: Hardware Designer and Firmware/GUI Developer. Uche is responsible for the design and development of the hardware components, as well as the graphical user interface (GUI) of the system.
Ashman Shehu: Software Developer and Database Designer. Ashman is focused on software development and oversees designing a robust relational database, with a strong preference for using MySQL.
Pat Nwoko: 
Computer Statistics Specialist and Human Resources Coordinator. Pat oversees Jira documentation, scheduling appointments, and managing purchases. With a background from the University of Nigeria Nsukka, Pat ensures that all administrative and organizational tasks are handled efficiently.
Solange Yehouenou:
 Software Developer with a BSc in Computer Science from the University of Bedfordshire. Solange contributes to designing the applicationâ€™s GUI and developing the programming code necessary for the system.
Project Objective: 
Our primary goal is to demonstrate that, despite being new graduates, we possess the expertise and creativity to deliver a high-quality, innovative home security system. The system is designed to be user-friendly and affordable, catering to a wide audience. By using collaborative tools like Jira, we have refined our development process, learning from past mistakes and continually improving our methods.
Project Features: 
The home security system we are developing will allow users to monitor their homes remotely while on holiday. Users will be able to watch live feeds, send and receive messages, and control various aspects of their home security from anywhere in the world. The software is being developed using JavaFX on the NetBeans IDE, chosen for its ease of integration with local databases such as MySQL.
Conclusion:
This project serves as a message to companies that underestimate the potential of fresh graduates: we are more than capable of delivering exceptional results. Our team is committed to the success of this project and confident that our home security system will gain recognition globally. Through hard work, collaboration, and a shared vision, we are set to create a product that not only meets but exceeds expectations, proving that experience is not the only determinant of success.
